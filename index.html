<div class="intro">
    <p> 
        Dr. Zhiming Cui is a tenure-track Assistant Professor in School of Biomedical Engieering, ShanghaiTech University. He received his Ph.D. degree in Computer vision and graphics Group at the University of Hong Kong(HKU) supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping">Wenping Wang</a>.
        Before that, he obtained his B.Eng and M.Eng degrees from Northeastern University in 2014 and 2017, respectively. 
        During his Ph.D. study, he also visited United Imaging Intelligence(UII) and ShanghaiTech University advised by Prof. <a href="http://idea.bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn/">Dinggang Shen</a>.
        Dr. Cui's work has been published in prestigious journals and conferences including Nature Communications, TMI, MedIA, TNNLS, MICCAI, CVPR, and ECCV, etc. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        IMPACT Lab was founded and directed by Dr. Cui since 2022 when he joined ShanghaiTech BME School.
        At the IMPACT Lab, we dedicate to fuse artificial intelligence and computer graphic into medical image computing, especially in the intersection of medical imaging computing, image reconstruction (e.g., CBCT, DSA, and PET/CT), and digital dentistry.
